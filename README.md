# July 2025 Cohort Hackathon 1: Portfolio Challenge - [Caleb Kiptoo]

## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to my submission for the PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge! This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, background, and achievements as a budding web developer. Built entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, it adheres to the core requirements of the hackathon, focusing on clear presentation and a user-friendly static experience.

The aim was to create a clean, responsive, and semantically structured web page that effectively communicates my professional profile to potential collaborators and employers.

## ‚ú® Project Sections & Features

My portfolio website includes the following key sections, as required by the challenge:

* **About Section:** A brief introduction about myself, my passion for tech, and what drives my journey in software development.
* **Programming Languages & Skills:** A comprehensive list of programming languages and technical skills I am proficient in or currently learning.
